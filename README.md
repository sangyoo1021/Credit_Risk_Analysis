# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

In this project we are given a dataset and tasked to evaluate reseample, oversample, undersample using few algorithms. Also, we are asked to compare new machine learning models that reduce bias to predict credit risk.

## Summary
When analyzing credit risk data, we need  to consider accuracy score and precision score. Each sample was analyzed so that accuracy score and precision score (with high risk and low risk) can be presented. 

Looking at my analysis, I can conclude that the Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier has the highest accuracy with 93%. The second highest accuracy is Balanced Random Forest Classifier which has 79% accuracy. However, all four Naive Random Oversampling, SMOTE oversampling, undersampling and combination sampling has below 70% accuracy which cannot be recommended.
